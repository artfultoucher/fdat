New and improved features compared to the last version
======================================================

PRIVACY

* Mail addresses are no longer shown to unauthorised users.

* The visibility of a project is now one of these:
  - private (owner only, formerly called 'unpublished'),
  - platform (logged in users only, this was requested by some lecturers),
  - public (formerly called 'published')

NEW: MATTERS

ACCOUNTS

  * Support for avatars (upload or gavatar).
  * Flexible permission system. This allows the administrator to deal with uncommon
    requests, e.g. approving a student to supervise a project.
  * Students are now required to identify their accounts with their UCC student ID.


NEW: SMALL PROJECTS

As before, there is no limit to the number of students which can be assigned to any
project which the system supports.
However, a given student can be assigned to only one "semester project" but to any number of
"small projects".
Thus, the relationship between the new small projects and students is many-to-many.
The old version only supported semester projects.
Lecturers are welcome to create small projects for any teaching purpose they wish.

MISCELLANEOUS

* You can now use Markdown formatting in the project descriptions.
* The type of a project's degree program (its associated matter) can now be changed in
  the edit view.
* Plenty of layout improvements.
