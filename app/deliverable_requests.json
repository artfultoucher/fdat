The format should allow for consistent reading, similar to a journal publication.\n\nThe purpose of this stage is to ensure that the student starts to write their final report in a timely fashion. The assessment and feedback should focus on the **quality of the document** and not on the technical quality of work per se. A pass judgment for this stage should not be construed as a promise that the work as a whole is pass worthy."
