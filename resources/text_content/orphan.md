#### What are Orphan Projects?

It is possible that a project has no supervisor attached. This occurs in two situations:

1. if a **student** creates a project
2. if a supervisor (who is always a lecturer) gives up their role as supervisor for some reason

Orphan projects **cannot be undertaken** by students, i.e. they **cannot be assigned to some student(s)** regardless whether the author of such a project is a student or a lecturer.
After a lecturer has taken over ("adopted") such a project, it is free for students to undertake.

Orphan projects are shown with yellow background.

####  How to Take Over an Orphan Project

Any **lecturer** can take over any orphan project as supervisor. To do so, bring up the detailled single project view (click on the book icon) and select **Engage->Lecturers->Supervise**. This will turn the project into the exact same category
as any other project which is supervised by that lecturer.
This step **does not assign any student** to the project.

There are multiple reasons why **taking over** an orphan project and **assigning students** to such a project are **two separate steps**. For instance:

- The author of the orphan project might be a **lecturer** in which case no student could be automatically assignend.
- The new supervisor wants to modify the project text before offering it back to students. In that case, the lecturer can afterwards even decide to **give up supervisorship again**. The project
will then become orphan again and the original author can make further modifications.
